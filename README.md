Data Structures and Algorithms:
I make no guarantees about the correctness of the written algorithms. I have used nearly all of these implementations in problems which gives some credibility to their correctness.
These implementations do not follow best practices for software development and are only intended to be used in the contest of competitive programming contests. 
This leads to an emphasis on "Shortness"/Ease of typing rather than readability or extendability.
All algorithms infer an implicit usage of using namespace std; (Don't do this outside competitive programming)
